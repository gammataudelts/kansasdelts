Goals of this refactoring are as follows:
	- Abstract all SQL calls into classes
	- Create class structures for each table in the mysql database
	- Combine pages that offer the same functionality into the same page
	- Break up the site into fucntional modules
	
Working code for review can be found in the following directories:
	- management
	- recruitment (in progress)
