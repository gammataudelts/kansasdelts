<h1>Academics </h1>
      <p>Everybody knows the reason you go to college is for academics. Post-graduate opportunities are linked directly to academic performance, and you owe it to yourself (and to the person paying for tuition) to do the best you can in the classroom.</p>
      <p>The Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity (DTD) has a proud legacy of academic excellence. Minimum GPA requirements for new Delt members and a history of putting classroom achievement first ensure that this tradition continues.</p>
      <p>When it comes to capitalizing on the college experience, it’s up to the students cracking the books, burning the midnight oil, and staying on top of their studies, to take full advantage. DTD’s history of academic excellence encourages each of its members to make the most of this exciting opportunity.</p>
      <p>If you’re looking for a fraternity that appreciates the value of a first-rate education, Delta Tau Delta is the perfect choice.</p>
      <p>Your path to a life of academic excellence starts here.</p>
