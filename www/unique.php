<h1>What makes Delt unique?</h1>
      <h3>Academics</h3>
      <p>Delta Tau Delta consistently ranks among the top of all Fraternities with regards to academics. For the last 5 years, Delta Tau Delta has found itself either at the top or near the top in terms of GPA. Our current GPA of 3.0 places us sixth amongst 22 fraturnities at the University of Kansas.</p>
      <h3>Values Based Organization</h3>
      <p>Delta Tau Delta is a value driven organization, and we strive to make all of our decisions based on our mission and values. Our members live by the principles of integrity, accountability, truth and courage. Building a fraternity around these values sets forth the expectations for how the fraternity will run and the behavior in the fraternity. Bringing these values into our Brotherhood allow for personal and organizational accountability and overall excellence.</p>
      <h3>Leadership Academy</h3>
      <p>The academy is a personal development process based on <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em> by Stephen Covey. This process is not designed to create better presidents or recruitment chairman, but to offer our undergraduates the opportunity to assess their personal skills, strengths and weaknesses; so that they may better prepare themselves for their future. Recently added to our leadership development opportunities is an experimental process that takes place in the Rocky Mountains, and another on the North Atlantic off the coast of Maine. The purpose of this expedition is to provide the basics of outdoor leadership including basic communication and leadership skills.    </p>
